# Suite Library for OpenUI5

## Description

:warning: _This library is in testing mode. We are still trying to figure out how to make it work with openui5. Stay tooned._


This is an open source extension library to [OpenUI5](https://github.com/SAP/openui5). It provides a couple of
useful controls for financial and enterprise use cases. Those controls can be used in UI5 base applications to enhance
visualisation of financial data, processes or communication.

Most controls are located in individual sub libraries to allow easier consumption. Each sub library is released on it's
 own and can be consumed as an npm dependency in consuming application.

For more information about individual controls please refer to the list below, where each component is described.
