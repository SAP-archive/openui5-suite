# Status Indicators

Status indicators were designed to be display animated KPIs. You can define your own shapes which will be filled
in an animation to a percentage you define.

To see them in action, have a look at their samples on 
[sapui5.hana.ondemand.com](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/entity/sap.suite.ui.commons.statusindicator.StatusIndicator).
